                <p>After learning the basic mechanics of the game, <b>build orders</b> are the most important thing for a new player to learn. Build orders determine the moments and order in which you should send a villager to a certain resource (food, wood, gold or stone). Builds are developed by the players to optimize the resource gathering for certain strategies, for example scout build, archer build or fast Castle age build.<br><br>Players who practise their build orders are often capable of defeating even technically better or faster players, if they are not using build orders. Aging up faster than the opponent (Fast Castle=FC) can be devastating for them, but doing this the player doesn't create military during Feudal age and may be overwhelmed before reaching Castle age by an opponent with more aggressive strategy.<br><br>At first it is enough to learn to repeat certain build orders, but eventually the player must learn to adapt to different situations without the security of pre-designed builds. The "feel" for managing resources comes with experience. Most build orders end after reaching Castle age, after which the player must be able to react to the opponent's strategies and military compositions.</p>

                <p>If multiplayer feels too stressful or just isn't your specific piece of cake, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition can also be played in single player mode with different game modes. Most popular are the campaigns, which are scripted, storybased scenarios where a player is given a certain number of units and an object to complete.<br><br>
                Over the years with each expansion the number of campaigns provided has grown by huge amounts. The player can play as a well known historic characters such as <i>Joan of Arc (Franks)</i>, <i>Attila the Hun (Huns)</i> or <i>Saladin (Saracens)</i>, or a less known character such as <i>Yodit (Ethiopians)</i>, <i>Bayinnaung (Burmese)</i> or <i>Kotyan Khan (Cumans)</i>. Including the ones mentioned the game includes 28 campaigns.<br><br>
                An option for longer campaigns is provided by historical battles, where a player may experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings"><i>the Battle of Hastings</i></a> in 1066 between Franks and Goths (Saxons), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade"><i>Richard the Lionhearts conquest of Cyprus during the Third Crusade</i></a> in 1191 with Britons against Byzantines and Italians, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lepanto"><i>the Battle of Lepanto</i></a> between Spanish and Turks and many more.</p>
