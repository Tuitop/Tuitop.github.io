                <h4>Build orders</h4>
                <p>After learning the basic mechanics of the game, <b>build orders</b> are the most important thing for a new player to learn. Build orders determine the moments and order in which you should send a villager to a certain resource (food, wood, gold or stone). Builds are developed by the players to optimize the resource gathering for certain strategies, for example scout build, archer build or fast Castle age build.<br><br>Players who practise their build orders are often capable of defeating even technically better or faster players, if they are not using build orders. Aging up faster than the opponent (Fast Castle=FC) can be devastating for them, but doing this the player doesn't create military during Feudal age and may be overwhelmed before reaching Castle age by an opponent with more aggressive strategy.<br><br>At first it is enough to learn to repeat certain build orders, but eventually the player must learn to adapt to different situations without the security of pre-designed builds. The "feel" for managing resources comes with experience. Most build orders end after reaching Castle age, after which the player must be able to react to the opponent's strategies and military compositions.</p>

                <p class="alateksti"><i>World Cup 2v2 2020 is currently ongoing with 32 top teams and 50 000 $ prize pool. The Finnish team is the reigning champion from 2018 and will play their quarter finals on 12.-13.12.</i></p>
            </div>
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-6">
                <p>In recent years there has been a growing number of tournaments organised for the AoE2 community. While still far from traditional esport-games and prize pools, major tournaments are now regularly showing prizepools of over 30 000 $.<br><br>
                In recent years three major 1v1 tournament franchises have been organised, all with different hosts. <i>King of the Desert</i> organised by Spanish streamer MembTV is a major tournament played exclusively on Arabia map, providing players a balanced setting to practise. <i>NAC (Nili's Apartment Cup)</i> is organised by former pro poker player, German streamer Nili_AoE. This is the only offline tournament of the three played offline having all players travel to Germany for the tournament. <i>The Hidden Cup</i>, organised by American T90Official, hides player's identities with aliases making it harder for players to prepare for their match not knowing who they are playing against. This also has the added entertainment factor for spectators to try and guess who the players are before they're revealed after the finals.<br><br>
                Age of Empires 2 can be played with teams including up to four players. While 1v1-tournaments are more popular, team games are also included in tournament pool with recent events such as <i>Battle of Africa</i> and <i>2v2 World Cup</i>, former having teams of three players and latter played with players representing their countries.<br><br>
                While major tournaments gain most attention and viewer numbers, the community hosts plenty of tournaments for players of all levels.</p>

                <h4>Single player</h4>
                <p>If multiplayer feels too stressful or just isn't your specific piece of cake, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition can also be played in single player mode with different game modes. Most popular are the campaigns, which are scripted, storybased scenarios where a player is given a certain number of units and an object to complete.<br><br>
                Over the years with each expansion the number of campaigns provided has grown by huge amounts. The player can play as a well known historic characters such as <i>Joan of Arc (Franks)</i>, <i>Attila the Hun (Huns)</i> or <i>Saladin (Saracens)</i>, or a less known character such as <i>Yodit (Ethiopians)</i>, <i>Bayinnaung (Burmese)</i> or <i>Kotyan Khan (Cumans)</i>. Including the ones mentioned the game includes 28 campaigns.<br><br>
                An option for longer campaigns is provided by historical battles, where a player may experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings"><i>the Battle of Hastings</i></a> in 1066 between Franks and Goths (Saxons), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade"><i>Richard the Lionhearts conquest of Cyprus during the Third Crusade</i></a> in 1191 with Britons against Byzantines and Italians, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lepanto"><i>the Battle of Lepanto</i></a> between Spanish and Turks and many more.</p>
