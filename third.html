                <h3>Maps</h3>
                <p>Aoe2:DE includes nearly infinite number of maps, since the game is open for players to modify the content themselves. Maps can commonly be divided in three categories: <i>land maps, hybrid maps</i> and <i>water maps.</i><br><br>
                Land maps include the most popular map called Arabia. It is considered the most competitive and even map of all, having good balance with open play and wallable terrain as well as a good balance with resource spawning. Arabia is prefered by the majority of top players<br><br>
                Hybrid maps include land and water with the main focus still being on land. Hybrid maps give variation to land maps as they present the option to fight for water control for more food income by fishing.<br><br>
                Water maps are highly focused on water control and cannot be won without a navy, separating them from hybrid maps where land play alone can win matches. Water maps are not popular in competitive play and they are often not included in high profile events.<br><br>
                Further diviation can be made defining maps open or closed. Arabia is a prime example of an open map, whereas Arena is typical example of a closed one, where player's start with stone walls not having to worry about early aggression from the opponent. Some players prefer Arena so much that they have specialized in playing mainly on Arena.<br><br>
                A differentiation can also be about the way the match starts. Usually player begins with a town center to produce villagers and set resources programmed to spawn within a certain distance from the town center. Nomad starts shake this preset by making the player start with three villagers randomly scattered accross the map, forcing the player to decide on where to set up the town center with no guarantee of future resources.</p>

                <h3>Civilizations</h3>
                <p>AoE2:DE contains 35 civilization from which the player can choose from. Each civilization has their own specialities and unique qualities. For example Briton crossbowmen have the longest range compared to any other crossbowmen and Franks can built castles usin less stone than other civilizations.<br><br>
                Military compositions can be rougly divided in three options: infantry, cavarly and ranged units. Choosing the civilization is important when considering which strategies the player will be using, because not all civilizations can be used for every tactics.<br><br>
                Mayans, Britons, Chinese and Ethiopians are top tier archer-civilizations, because they all have fully upgraded range units available and an added bonus technology for archer play.<br><br>
                Franks, Huns, Berbers and Lithuanians on the other hand excel in cavalry play with each having their respected bonuses towards stable units.<br><br>
                Civilizations focused on infantry are often not considered top tier civilizations, since where as infantry is meant to counter cavalry (in a theoretical triangle with cavalry better than archers, archers over infantry and infantry coutnering cavalry) it is often too slow and cavalry players utilise their mobility hitting on areas where the infantry is not stationed. Infantry has it's places, often providing support for ranged units or siege units against cavalry since ranged and siege units "force" the battle by providing a threat the cavalry player can't ignore.<br><br>
                Since infantry often requires something else to accompany, Slavs and Celts can be consideres top tier infantry + siege civilizations having bonuses on both lines of production.<br><br>
                Full list of civilizations with a brief introduction on their specialities and unique abilities can be found on the link below.<br><br>

                <h3>Game modes</h3>
                <p>Aoe2:DE is usually played with <b>conquest</b> settings, which states that and opponent can only be defeated by defeating their military and demolishing production buildings preventing opposing reproduction. In this game mode the opponent usually resigns when the game is practically lost, so it is rarely seen that all military, villagers and buildings are killed and demolished.<br><br>
                Game can however be played with great many settings for winning, some of which are described below:<br><br>
                In <b>standard</b> game mode the player can win by defeating the opponent as in <i>conquest</i>, but has also two other options: Player may gather all the <i>relics</i> in the map (relics are gathered with monks) and if he/she is able to maintain control over all the relics within the monasteries for a certain period of time the opponent is defeated. Another way is to build a <i>wonder</i> which requires a huge amount of resources and take a lot of time to construct even with multiple villagers. If the player manages to build a wonder, it must then stand for a set period of time for the player to win.<br><br>
                In <b>Regicide</b> mode the players start with a castle and a king along with the villagers. Opposition can again be defeated as in <i>conquest</i> but also by just killing their king.<br><br>
                In <b>King of the Hill</b> the middle of the map has a monument which a player may take control of by placing a unit within its reach. This triggers a countdown, and whoever maintains control over the monument as time runs out wins the game. Player maintains control as long as he/she has at least one unit within the reach of the monument, so the only way to take control over the monument is to take out the opposing units occupying it.</p>
