                <p>Age of Empires 2 (AoE2) was first released in 1999 by Microsoft. This real-time strategy game is the second installment of "Age of Empires" brand following Age of Empires, which was released in 1998. AoE2 consists of different civilizations with which the player must complete the objective, most common of which being conquering the opposition by defeating their army. This is done by collecting resources and building a town with villagers, and training and upgrading the military with the resources gathered. Difficulty of the game comes from being able to assing the right amount of villagers per resource in order to effectivily spend the resources and get the military numbers out before the opposition and making the right decisions strategy-wise regarding the military composition.<br><br>
                    When released the game consisted of 13 civilizations. After that the game has had expansions adding to the number of civilizations and currently there are 35 playable civilization including for example Britons, Huns and Mayans.<br><br>
                    For an old game, AoE2 is thriving. As the game grew in popularity especially since the release of HD edition in 2013, Microsoft has kept a close eye on the franchise. Growing number of players and spectators resulted in the re-release of the game with Definitive Edition, that succesfully added graphics improvements and new quality of life -features while remaining loyal to the basic features of the original version.</p>
